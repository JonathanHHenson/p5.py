# HiDPI and pixel-density rendering

p5-py uses a p5-style distinction between logical canvas coordinates and physical device pixels.

For example, on a Retina display, this sketch creates a logical canvas of `640 x 420`:

```python
create_canvas(640, 420)
```

If the active display density is `2`, the canvas backend renders into a physical backing buffer of `1280 x 840` while preserving the logical p5 coordinate system. A call like this still uses logical coordinates:

```python
circle(320, 210, 100)
```

Internally, the canvas renderer scales drawing coordinates, transforms, images, pixel buffers, and stroke weights by the active pixel density before rasterizing, reading back, exporting, or presenting.

## APIs

```python
pixel_density()
pixel_density(2)
display_density()
```

p5.js-style camelCase aliases such as `pixelDensity()` and `displayDensity()` are intentionally not exported.

## Backend behavior

- Bounded offscreen canvas runs default to pixel density `1` unless a sketch explicitly requests another density.
- Interactive canvas runs may use the native display density reported by the canvas runtime.
- `width()` and `height()` return logical canvas dimensions.
- The renderer tracks physical backing-buffer dimensions separately.
- `load_pixels()` and `update_pixels()` operate on the physical backing buffer, so the pixel list length is `logical_width * logical_height * pixel_density * pixel_density * 4` for RGBA data.
- `save_canvas()` exports the physical backing buffer, which keeps output sharp on HiDPI displays.

## Example

```python
from p5 import *


def setup():
    create_canvas(640, 420)
    print(width(), height())          # 640 420
    print(pixel_density())            # often 2.0 on Retina displays


def draw():
    background(245)
    circle(width() / 2, height() / 2, 120)


run()
```
