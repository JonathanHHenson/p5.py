# Native Pyglet renderer plan

## Current state

The interactive Pyglet backend now uses a native renderer by default:

```text
p5-py public API
  ↓
SketchContext
  ↓
Renderer protocol
  ↓
PygletRenderer
  ↓
Pyglet shape draw commands
  ↓
Pyglet/OpenGL framebuffer
```

The previous bridge backend was useful for the first implementation because it gave p5-py one deterministic renderer for both tests and interactive sketches. The native path removes the per-frame Pillow raster upload from the default interactive backend while preserving the same public p5-py APIs.

Pillow remains the deterministic renderer for the headless backend, golden tests, pixel-buffer workflows, and non-interactive export.

## Architecture

The architecture separates the window/event backend from the renderer:

```text
p5-py public API
  ↓
SketchContext
  ↓
Renderer protocol
  ↓
PygletRenderer
  ↓
Pyglet/OpenGL framebuffer
```

With this split:

- `PygletBackend` owns the window, event loop, input events, resize events, frame scheduling, and shutdown.
- `PygletRenderer` owns native drawing operations.
- `SketchContext` continues to depend only on the renderer/backend protocols.
- The public API remains unchanged.
- Pillow remains the deterministic headless renderer and export/golden-test path.

## Module layout

The first native milestone keeps the backend as a single file and adds a separate renderer module:

```text
src/p5_py/backends/pyglet.py            # window, event loop, input, scheduling
src/p5_py/backends/pyglet_renderer.py   # native drawing through Pyglet shapes
```

The backend can still be split into a package later if Pyglet-specific event, renderer, or capability code grows enough to justify it.

## Responsibilities

### `PygletBackend`

Responsible for:

- creating the native window
- detecting display density / framebuffer size
- running the Pyglet event loop
- scheduling frames
- normalizing mouse and keyboard events
- forwarding resize and close events
- exposing backend capabilities

Not responsible for:

- parsing p5-style arguments
- managing drawing style state
- implementing p5.js aliases
- owning sketch lifecycle semantics
- deciding fill/stroke behavior

### `PygletRenderer`

Responsible for:

- `begin_frame` / `end_frame`
- `background` and `clear`
- points, lines, polygons, rectangles, ellipses, arcs
- fill and stroke rendering
- transform application
- HiDPI coordinate mapping
- image/text support when those epics are implemented
- pixel/export capability handling

## Rendering approach options

### Pyglet shapes

Pros:

- simple first implementation
- clean dependency story
- works with Pyglet's supported public APIs

Cons:

- may not support all stroke joins/caps/fill rules needed for p5 fidelity
- complex paths may require flattening and triangulation

### Batched vertex lists

Pros:

- better performance than recreating shapes every frame
- more control over geometry

Cons:

- more renderer complexity
- requires careful lifecycle and batching design

### Direct OpenGL or ModernGL-style rendering

Pros:

- best long-term performance/control
- natural path toward WEBGL-like features later

Cons:

- larger implementation scope
- shader and context management complexity
- more difficult to keep beginner-friendly and cross-platform

## First native renderer milestone

The first native renderer uses Pyglet shapes plus shared p5-py geometry helpers. This keeps the implementation small and on public Pyglet APIs before introducing lower-level batching or custom OpenGL geometry.

Implemented:

- `background`
- `clear`
- `point`
- `line`
- `polygon`
- `rect`
- `square`
- `ellipse`
- `circle`
- `triangle`
- `quad`
- `arc`

The public `SketchContext` continues to flatten these into renderer polygons or polylines before calling the renderer:

- Bezier curves
- quadratic curves
- custom shapes created by `begin_shape`, `vertex`, `quadratic_vertex`, `bezier_vertex`, and `end_shape`
- arcs where native support is insufficient

## HiDPI behavior

The native renderer preserves the current pixel-density model:

- `width()` and `height()` are logical p5 canvas dimensions.
- `display_density()` reports the native display density when available.
- `pixel_density()` controls the logical-to-physical scale.
- Pyglet native drawing should not double-scale on Retina displays.

`PygletRenderer` receives logical p5 coordinates, applies the active p5-py affine transform, scales by `pixel_density`, and flips the y axis into Pyglet's bottom-left framebuffer coordinate system:

```text
framebuffer_x = logical_x * pixel_density
framebuffer_y = physical_height - logical_y * pixel_density
```

The renderer tracks both logical dimensions and physical framebuffer dimensions so `width()`, `height()`, `pixel_density()`, and `display_density()` remain distinct concepts.

## Pixel and export APIs

The native renderer capability-gates these APIs in the first milestone:

- `load_pixels`
- `update_pixels`
- `save_canvas`

They raise `BackendCapabilityError` with guidance to use the headless backend. Pillow remains the canonical deterministic path for headless rendering, image export, and golden tests.

Future native support can use framebuffer readback for `load_pixels` and `save_canvas`, and either texture upload/update or an explicit documented limitation for `update_pixels`.

## Migration status

1. `PygletRenderer` exists as a concrete implementation of the `Renderer` protocol.
2. Basic primitive rendering is implemented through Pyglet-native draw commands.
3. Transform, path, and curve support is provided by applying p5-py transform matrices and reusing shared geometry flattening before renderer calls.
4. HiDPI logical and physical dimensions are covered by focused unit tests.
5. Pixel and export behavior is explicitly capability-gated for the native renderer.
6. `PygletBackend` uses `PygletRenderer` by default.
7. The bridge-specific Pillow image upload path has been removed from the default Pyglet backend.
8. The headless Pillow backend remains available for deterministic export and tests.
