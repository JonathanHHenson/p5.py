# Images, Pixels, and Assets

## Images

- `load_image(path)`
- `load_image_async(path)`
- `create_image(width, height)`
- `image(img, x, y, width=None, height=None, ...)`
- `image_mode(mode)`
- `image_sampling(mode)`
- `smooth()`
- `no_smooth()`

Images are loaded by the Rust canvas runtime. There is no Pillow fallback.
Async loader variants are awaitable and useful from `async def preload()` or
`async def setup()` callbacks.

`load_image()` returns the normal Python `Image` type, but the object keeps its
Rust-managed asset internally until the first pixel mutation. Drawing an
untouched loaded image can therefore stay on the renderer's fast sprite path.
Calling `set()`, `update_pixels()`, `resize()`, `mask()`, or `filter()` makes
the image mutable Python pixel data and future draws upload the changed version
through the bounded image cache. Bulk image-local work such as resize, mask,
filter, crop/copy, and alpha compositing is delegated to the Rust canvas
extension so the public Python API does not run nested per-pixel loops for
normal image sizes.

`smooth()` and `image_sampling(LINEAR)` request linear sampling.
`no_smooth()` and `image_sampling(NEAREST)` request nearest-neighbor sampling.
The renderer may choose the fastest supported path for the current sampling
mode, transform, blend mode, and backend capabilities.

Image objects also support Python indexing:

```python
color = img[x, y]
img[x, y] = p5.Color(255, 0, 0)
tile = img[x0:x1, y0:y1]
```

## Pixels

- `load_pixels()`
- `load_pixel_bytes()`
- `update_pixels()`
- `pixels()`
- `pixel_array()`
- `get(...)`
- `set(...)`

Pixel buffers are physical RGBA buffers. When `pixel_density()` is greater than
`1`, the physical pixel size is larger than the logical canvas size.

`load_pixels()` returns a compatibility `list[int]`. Use `load_pixel_bytes()`
for performance-sensitive readback when a bytes-like RGBA buffer is enough.
`update_pixels()` accepts the list returned by `load_pixels()` and efficient
buffer-like inputs such as `bytes`, `bytearray`, and `memoryview`.

Performance diagnostics can be enabled when investigating slow pixel or image
paths:

```python
p5.enable_performance_diagnostics()
pixels = p5.load_pixels()
report = p5.performance_diagnostics()
```

The report contains counters and short public-language messages for readback,
pixel list conversion, pixel upload, texture upload/cache hits, and CPU
compositing fallback helpers such as canvas `get()`, `set()`, and `filter()`.
Small canvas `get(x, y)`, `get(x, y, w, h)`, and `set(...)` operations route
through Rust region APIs and avoid reconstructing a full Python `Image` where
possible. Full-canvas `load_pixels()` remains a full physical-buffer readback.

Renderer/runtime counters are available separately:

```python
p5.reset_renderer_performance_counters()
# draw representative frames
report = p5.renderer_performance_counters()
```

Text-heavy sketches can inspect `text_cache_hits`, `text_cache_misses`,
`text_cache_evictions`, and `text_measurements` in that report to spot dynamic
text churn.

For native interactive timing, enable frame pacing diagnostics and inspect
`frame_pacing_diagnostics()` for draw, present, frame-interval, and input-poll
timings.

## Export

- `save_canvas(path=None)`
- `save_bytes(data, path)`
- `save_json(data, path)`
- `save_strings(lines, path)`
- `create_writer(path)`

## Data and Text Assets

- `load_json(path)`
- `load_json_async(path)`
- `load_strings(path)`
- `load_strings_async(path)`
- `load_bytes(path)`
- `load_bytes_async(path)`
- `load_font(path)`
- `load_font_async(path)`

## Sound and Media

- `load_sound(path)`
- `load_sound_async(path)`
- `create_audio(...)`
- `create_capture(...)`
- `create_capture_async(...)`
- `create_video(...)`
- `create_video_async(...)`

Some media helpers require installing the `media` extra.
Decoded grayscale, BGR, and BGRA frames are converted to p5 RGBA image buffers
by the Rust canvas extension once the optional media dependency supplies a
contiguous frame buffer.

3D asset helpers also include awaitable variants:

- `load_model_async(path, normalize=False, package=None)`
- `load_shader_async(vertex_path, fragment_path)`

Wavefront OBJ parsing and normalization are handled by the Rust canvas
extension and adapted back to the public Python `Model3D` / `Mesh3D` data
classes.
