# API Performance Policy

Public APIs should be easy to start with and predictable under load. When those
goals conflict, keep the default path clear and provide an explicit fast path
instead of exposing renderer or Rust internals.

## API Classes

Fast-default APIs are expected to be suitable inside `draw()` and moderate
loops without extra ceremony. This includes primitive drawing, style changes,
transforms, cached image drawing, text measurement with stable style, vector
math, random/noise helpers, and context managers such as `style()`,
`transform()`, and `pushed()`.

Compatibility APIs preserve familiar p5 behavior even when they allocate or
convert data. This includes global-mode dispatch, vector-like argument
normalization, `load_pixels()` returning `list[int]`, `pixels()`, `pixel_array()`,
and p5.js compatibility stubs. Document a faster Pythonic alternative when one
exists.

Advanced APIs are supported but may have backend-dependent costs. This includes
blend modes, text shaping/metrics, image sampling modes, WEBGL-style 3D,
shader objects, and model/image asset loading. Keep capability errors explicit
and avoid promising native acceleration unless the backend reports it.

Intentionally slow or diagnostic APIs should be opt-in or visibly named for
inspection. This includes performance diagnostics, full-canvas readback,
canvas-to-image helpers such as `get()`, CPU image filters applied to the
canvas, and benchmark-only utilities.

## Hot-Loop Guidance

`p5.fast()` and `Sketch.fast()` return a frame-local facade for dense 2D loops.
It keeps public p5 style and transform state but skips repeated global-mode
context lookup and flexible argument normalization for the hottest drawing
calls. Create it inside the scope whose style/transform state should apply:

```python
def draw():
    p5.background(245)
    draw_fast = p5.fast()
    with p5.style(stroke=(20, 80, 160, 180)):
        for x, y, dx, dy in vectors:
            draw_fast.line(x, y, x + dx, y + dy)
```

Use normal global-mode calls in simple sketches and setup code. Use local
bindings or `p5.fast()` in loops that issue hundreds or thousands of primitive,
image, or text-measurement calls per frame.

## Pixels And Images

Prefer renderer-native drawing over full-canvas pixel workflows. Use
`load_pixel_bytes()` for readback when a bytes-like RGBA buffer is sufficient.
Use `update_pixels()` with `bytes`, `bytearray`, or `memoryview` for uploads.
Keep loaded images immutable where possible so the Rust-managed asset and image
cache remain useful. Mutating image pixels is supported, but repeated per-frame
mutations should be treated as texture upload work.

## Diagnostics

Performance diagnostics are opt-in:

```python
p5.enable_performance_diagnostics()
# draw or inspect
report = p5.performance_diagnostics()
```

Counters use public terms:

- `pixel_readback`: reading canvas pixels back to Python.
- `pixel_list_conversion`: materializing or consuming Python pixel lists.
- `pixel_upload`: sending a full pixel buffer to the canvas.
- `texture_upload`: drawing a new or changed Python `Image`.
- `texture_cache_hit`: drawing an unchanged Python `Image` already seen.
- `cpu_compositing_fallback`: using a canvas helper that copies pixels through
  Python image operations.

Diagnostics must not print by default or mention private Rust implementation
details in user-facing messages.

## Adding Public APIs

When adding an API, classify it in this document's terms before documenting it.
If the API is likely to be used in `draw()`, include an allocation and dispatch
budget in tests or benchmarks. If it is compatibility-oriented or diagnostic,
make the cost explicit in reference docs and provide the fast-default route.
